# BeastBar

Python case study, idea built on Beasty Bar card game

## Overview

We are testing OOP best practices and Design Patterns in Python. We liked the [Beasty Bar game by Stefan Kloß and Alexander Jung](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/165950/beasty-bar) and use the game mechanics as an case study. 

We explicitly do not intend to provide a comfortable user interface. First, because we are only interested in the class structure, second, because the authors may have a say in this.
